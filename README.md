Welcome to Baby Steps! This web app is a simple and easy way for parents to track their child's development and milestones.

With Baby Steps, you can store information about your child's achievements and special moments, and even upload corresponding pictures. The app automatically calculates the age of your child for each milestone and adds it to a one-scroll timeline, making it easy to see their progress at a glance.
